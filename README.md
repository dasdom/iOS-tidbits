# iOS tidbits ✨

## General

Swipe sideways directly on the home indicator to switch between recent apps. There's no need to invoke the app switcher for this.


## Calculator

Delete incorrect input by swiping on the display.


## Maps

US addresses have the house number up front, many other countries don't. But you can still enter the number first to use the autocompletion without it immediately triggering a search for the incomplete query. E.g. type "19 Rothenbu" to use the autocompletion to search for "Rothenburger Straße 19".


## Screenshots

Cropping screenshots snaps to view boundaries.


## Keyboard

3D Touch can not just be used to move the cursor, but by pressing harder you can also select ranges or, by pressing harder yet again, select entire sentences.

Select text on non-3D-Touch devices by using a second finger ([thanks Martin](https://twitter.com/mrtnlst/status/1184201308020137984?s=21)).


## Camera

Camera can scan QR codes directly, don't install 3rd party apps for this.
