# iOS tidbits âœ¨

## Calculator

Delete incorrect input by swiping on the display.


## Maps

US addresses have the house number up front, many other countries don't. But you can still enter the number first to use the autocompletion without it immediately triggering a search for the incomplete query.


## Screenshots

Cropping screenshots snaps to view boundaries.


## Keyboard

3D Touch can not just be used to move the cursor, but by pressing harder you can also select ranges or, by pressing harder yet again, select entire sentences.
